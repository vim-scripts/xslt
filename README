The Xslt plugin is the best vim plugin available to edit xsl files. I say its  
the best because I could not find any other script and had to make one!

Once the Xslt plugin is installed, simply press the <F2> key in Insert
mode after the proper keywords and xsl text will be generated.

You also need to have xmledit plugin installed.
